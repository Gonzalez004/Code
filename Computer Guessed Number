/*Write an advanced version of the number guessing game from Monday.
In this version, *you* choose a number,
and the computer continuously guesses what number you picked until it guesses correctly.
After each guess, you'll tell the computer if it's too high or low,
which helps it adjust its guess.
At the end, it prints out how many turns it took to guess,
and asks if you want to play again.
Try to make your program take the smallest number of guesses it can!*/
